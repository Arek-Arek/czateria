# czateria in Qt

This repository contains a reimplementation of the protocol used by the Polish
chatroom network called Czateria, along with a simple GUI.

Basic functionality, that is :

 * logging in as a guest with and without a nickname,
 * logging in as a registered user,
 * sending and receiving chatroom messages,
 * sending and receiving private messages,
 * receiving images in private conversations

is working.

Certain things are missing, most notably sending images, graphical icons in
conversations, full user profile information, and text formatting.
